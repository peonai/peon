## The Problem Nobody Talks About

You use Claude for coding. ChatGPT for writing. Gemini for research. A local agent for automation.

Every single one starts from zero. Every single one asks the same questions:

> "What's your preferred language?"
> "What tech stack do you use?"
> "What's your timezone?"

You repeat yourself. Endlessly. Across devices, across platforms, across agents. **N devices × M agents = N×M information silos.**

I got tired of it. So I built something.

## What Is Swarm AI?

Swarm AI is a self-hosted server that gives all your AI agents a shared memory. One agent learns something about you — every agent knows it.

Think of it as a user profile API that any agent can read and write. Identity, preferences, work context, communication style — organized into layers, scored by confidence, attributed by source.

```
Agent A ──┐                    ┌── Profile (layered)
Agent B ──┤── Swarm API ──────┤── Memory (FTS5)
Agent C ──┘   (REST + JWT)     └── Audit Log
```

No SDK. No framework lock-in. If your agent can make HTTP requests, it can join the swarm.

## The 30-Second Onboarding

This is the part I'm most proud of.

Traditional integration: read docs → install SDK → configure auth → write integration code → test → deploy. That's hours of work per agent.

Swarm's approach: **copy a prompt, paste it to your agent, done.**

Here's how it works:

1. Open the Swarm dashboard
2. Click "Copy Prompt" on the onboarding card
3. Send it to any AI agent

The prompt contains a `llms.txt` URL with your API token baked in. The agent reads it, learns the API, and starts syncing — all in one conversation turn.

```
Connect to my Swarm AI profile system.
Read the docs at https://hive.example.com/llms.txt?key=swarm_xxx
and use it to learn about me and remember what you learn.
```

That's it. Zero config files. Zero code. The agent teaches itself.

## How It Actually Works

### Layered Profiles

Data is organized into free-form layers:

- **identity** — name, language, timezone
- **preferences** — tech stack, editor, communication style
- **work** — projects, role, GitHub
- **context** — ephemeral, auto-expires in 24h

Each entry carries a confidence score. High-confidence facts (user explicitly stated) never get overwritten by low-confidence guesses (agent inferred from context).

### Shared Memory

Beyond structured profiles, agents can write and search free-text memories:

```
POST /api/v1/memory
{"content": "User completed the Swarm AI launch", "tags": ["milestone"]}
```

Full-text search via FTS5. Optional semantic search if you configure an embedding API.

### Multi-User & Tenant Isolation

Every user gets their own isolated data space. Admin controls who can access what. Agents registered under your account only see your data.

### Observe API

Don't want to manually structure data? Just throw natural language at it:

```
POST /api/v1/profile/observe
{"text": "The user prefers TypeScript and uses VSCode on WSL2"}
```

Swarm extracts the structured profile entries automatically.

## Why Self-Hosted?

Your profile data is deeply personal. It's literally a map of who you are, what you do, and how you think. That data should live on **your** server, under **your** control.

Swarm runs as a single Next.js process with SQLite. One command to install:

```bash
npx @peonai/swarm
```

The interactive CLI asks for port, admin token, and optionally sets up a systemd service. Under a minute from zero to running.

## What's Next

- **MCP Server** — native integration for agents that support Model Context Protocol
- **Conflict resolution** — smarter merging when agents disagree
- **Profile versioning** — time-travel through your profile history
- **Federation** — multiple Swarm instances sharing data (with consent)

## Try It

Swarm AI is open source under MIT.

- **npm**: `npx @peonai/swarm`
- **GitHub**: [github.com/peonai/swarm](https://github.com/peonai/swarm)
- **Live demo**: [hive.peonai.net](http://hive.peonai.net)

If you're tired of repeating yourself to every new AI agent, give it a shot. One install, one prompt, and your agents finally talk to each other.
